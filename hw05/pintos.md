Pintos - Threading
=====================

In this segment of the homework, we improved upon the existing implementation of `thread_sleep` by modifying the code to block/resume the current thread instead of yielding. 

For emulation we used bochs 2.4, which must be compiled with the --with-nogui flag in order to function properly with pintos.  Installing from apt-get yields errors because the binary installed was not compiled with these options.

Below are the functions we modified, and a brief description of what we did:

```C
/* Sleeps for approximately TICKS timer ticks.  Interrupts must
   be turned on. */
void timer_sleep (int64_t ticks) { 
   // ignore negative `ticks` values
   if (ticks > 0) {
     ASSERT (intr_get_level () == INTR_ON);
     // assign requested sleep time to current thread
     thread_current()->ticks = ticks;
     // disable interrupts to allow thread blocking
     enum intr_level old_level = intr_disable();
     thread_block();
     // revert to old interrupt level to ensure that no other logic crashes 
     intr_set_level(old_level);
   }
}
```

```C
void thread_wake (struct thread *t, void *aux){
  // at every tick, decrement the ticks remaining until unblock
  if (t->status == THREAD_BLOCKED) {
    t->ticks--;
    if (!t->ticks) {
      // when 0 ticks remain, unblock the thread.
      thread_unblock(t);
    }
  }
}
```


We added a uint64 to the thread struct to keep track of how long it needs to block for before waking up. When called on a thread, this new function decrements that counter if the thread is currently blocked.  When the number of ticks for a thread becomes 0, the thread is unblocked.

```
timer_interrupt (struct intr_frame *args UNUSED)
{
  // called every tick
  ticks++;
  thread_tick ();
  thread_foreach(thread_wake, NULL);
}
```

We added a call to the thread_wake function on each thread every time the interrupt triggers, so that sleeping threads can be woken.

We strived for clean, simple code rather than efficiency.

Future work:
-------------
We did not take a crack at prioritization, but to do so we would need to add a priority field to the thread struct, and alter the scheduling procedure to switch context to threads with the highest priority first.  While running, the threadâ€™s priority would be gradually decreased.  To implement this we would want to create a list of threads and sort it based on descending priority, then pop off of the front of that list in the next_thread_to_run function.
